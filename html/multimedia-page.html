    <h2>Transcript</h2>
    <p>
      In this video, we explore the JavaScript <code>map()</code> method, which allows you to transform elements in an array by applying a function to each item. It's a powerful tool for creating new arrays based on existing data, often used in functional programming. The video walks through examples and explains how <code>map()</code> differs from <code>forEach()</code> and other iteration methods.
